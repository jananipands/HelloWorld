## Notes

While Kotlin was fairly easy to grasp, I found it difficult to manuever through Android Studio. Since there were various controls and buttons,
I found myself spending more time on finding the different files in the file explorer instead of creating my app itself. In addition to the 
various controls, the layout of Android Studio felt cluttered as there were many windows I needed to manage. However, after working on the app
for a few hours, I was able to familiarize myself with the Android Studio environment as well as the terminology used in Android Development. 
I was also able to explore into the usage of libraries for Android Apps, which was how I had a circular ImageView for the profile photo. 
Overall, this process made me very interested in Android Development and I learned so much from this hands-on assignment.
